[Scene: Chandler's office in Tulsa.�� His assistant is showing him photographs.]
JO LYNN: This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy 
  in the cat condo is Jinkies.
CHANDLER: Yep.� That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn.� Single are ya?
(Phone rings.� Chandler answers using the speaker phone.)
CHANDLER: Chandler Bing.
JOEY: Hey.� How come you're answering your own phone?� Where's your crazy assistant?
(She frowns.� Chandler picks up the hand set.)
CHANDLER: What's up Joe?
JOEY: Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
CHANDLER: Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
JOEY: No, no, no.� When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to 
  be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . .� courtside!
CHANDLER: Courtside?� Oh my God.
JOEY: Yeah.� Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with 
  his knee.
CHANDLER: That's so cool.� I'll let Monica know.
(Chandler hangs up and calls Monica who is reading a book on their sofa as 
  the phone rings.)
MONICA: Hello?
CHANDLER: Joey just called.� He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and 
  me tomorrow night.
MONICA: Really?� But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.� 
  If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
CHANDLER: But hey, it's courtside.� The cheerleaders are going to be right 
  in fr. . . (Pause)� That's not the way to convince you. 
MONICA: Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You 
  can't go to the game.� You have to spend time with me."� So, if you could just 
  realize it on your own . . . 
CHANDLER: I know.� You're right.� I want to see you too.� I've just got to 
  figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?� He's really looking forward to this.
MONICA: Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.� Tell him 
  that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.� Tell him that 
  what little time we have is precious.
CHANDLER: Yeah, ah, ah . . .� I'll think of something.
[ OPENING CREDITS ]
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.� Ross is in the living room covering Emma.� 
  Rachel enters wearing a sexy dress.]
ROSS: Wow!� (pause)� Wow, You look . . . uh . . .�� It's just, ah . . .�� That 
  dress . . . uh . . .� 
RACHEL: Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
ROSS: Well, well, they're good.� It's been a while since I've seen you like 
  this.� You, you clean up good.
RACHEL: Oh well, well thank you.� (She laughs.� He stares for a moment.)� Okay, 
  stop.� Stop looking at me like that.� The last time that happened, (points 
  to Ross) that happened.� (points to Emma.)
ROSS: Oh right, right.� (They pause and exchange a glance. Then, Ross looks 
  away.)� So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night 
  away from Emma?
RACHEL: Yeah, yeah.� Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun.� And thank 
  you for watching the baby, by the way.
ROSS: Oh, it's fine.� Actually, I, I invited Mike over.
RACHEL: Phoebe's Mike?
ROSS: Yeah.
RACHEL: I didn't know you guys hung out.
ROSS: We don't.� But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.� You know, 
  maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
RACHEL: Oh that's so cute:� Ross and Mike's first date.� Is that going to be 
  awkward?� I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?
ROSS: I don't know.� But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.� 
  He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.� He's been divorced; I have some 
  experience in that area.
(Rachel nods.� There is a knock on the door.)
RACHEL: Yeah.
(Phoebe and Mike enter.)
PHOEBE: Hi
RACHEL: Hey.
PHOEBE: (spotting Rachel's dress) Oooh.� Girl's night out indeed.
RACHEL: (to Ross) Ok.� So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, 
  but if you need anything Ross . . . 
ROSS: Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?� You go have fun.
RACHEL: Okay.� You too.� And I hope you score.� (to Mike) Bye.
MIKE: Bye.
ROSS: So . . .� Welcome.
MIKE: (Holds up a six pack of Foster's Lager) I got beer.
ROSS: I got bottled breast milk.
MIKE: Eh, why don't we start with the beer?
ROSS: Okay.� (They sit.)� So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.
MIKE: Yeah.
ROSS: You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.
MIKE: Ah?� (pause)� Do you have one here?
ROSS: No.
MIKE: Okay.� (pause)
(They clink beer bottles, and drink.� Then, they stare uncomfortably at their 
  bottles.)
ROSS: Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced.� Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe 
  said you . . . You've been divorced?
MIKE: Yeah.� (pause)� Yeah, I'm sorry.� I don't . . . I don't really like to 
  talk about it.
ROSS: (pause) That's okay.� We'll talk about (pause) something else.� (They 
  pause.� They drink.)
MIKE:� So, you're a paleontologist, right?
ROSS: Yeah.
MIKE: My cousin's a paleontologist.
ROSS: Ah?� (Mike nods.� Another pause.)� Well, he and I would probably have 
  a lot to talk about.
[Scene:� Monica and Chandler's apartment.� Monica is wearing a sexy negligee.� 
  She pours two glasses of wine as Chandler enters with a carry-on suitcase.� 
  He sets the case by the door.) 
MONICA: Hi.
CHANDLER: Hey.
MONICA: Welcome home.
CHANDLER: (Hangs his jacket over the suitcase, locks the door, then turns to 
  Monica.)� Oh well, look at you.
MONICA: Yeah.� What do you think?
CHANDLER: Well, it looks great.� It's just that . . . well, I'm wearing the 
  same thing underneath.� So . . .
MONICA: Oh.
CHANDLER: See what I mean . . . (They kiss.)
(There is a loud thud at the door.)
JOEY: Hey!� How come the door's locked?
MONICA: Just a second.
CHANDLER: (hushed) No, no, no, no, no.� Joey can't know that I'm here.
MONICA: Why not?
CHANDLER: Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks 
  game.� So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.
MONICA: So, you lied to him?
CHANDLER: Achhh.� It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.� 
  (pause)� Except with you.
JOEY: Hey!� Open the door.� What's going on?� (He knocks.)
(Monica goes to the door.� Chandler slides behind it as she opens it slightly.)
JOEY: What are you . ..� (He sees her in her negligee.)� Why are you dressed 
  like that?
MONICA: Oh, because, um . . .� well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple 
  of days.� So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.
JOEY: Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.
MONICA: Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.� You know, 
  like, "Hi, How do I look?"� (As Chandler) "Really sexy.� Could I BE any more 
  turned on?"
JOEY: Okay.� (pause.� He looks over her shoulder at the table with the wine.)� 
  Whoa, whoa.� Why are there two glasses of wine out?
MONICA: Because. . .� one of them is for you.
(Monica turns to get the wine.� Chandler peeps through the peephole.� Joey, 
  seeing something, peeps back.� Chandler ducks.� Monica returns with two glasses 
  of wine.� She gives one to Joey.)
MONICA: Cheers.� (She clinks his glass and pulls back.)� Okay, buh-bye.� (She 
  closes the door.)
CHANDLER: You know, it's funny.� I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction 
  myself.� (He raises his hands in front of himself, sticks out his behind, and 
  wiggles it.)� Hi ya.
MONICA: You might want to keep practicing.
CHANDLER: Yah.
(Chandler's cell phone rings.� He looks at it.)
CHANDLER: It's Joey.� (He answers it, holding it out so that Monica can hear 
  too.)� Hey Joe.
JOEY: Dude, come home!
CHANDLER: What? Why?
JOEY: COME . . .� HOME.
CHANDLER: Look I, I can't.� What's going on?
JOEY: I don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . I think Monica's cheatin' 
  on ya.� I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.
(Chandler and Monica look at each other.� Chandler nods.)
JOEY: All right look.� (He walks to the hallway.)� If you can't come home and 
  deal with this, then I'm gonna.
CHANDLER: NO!
JOEY: (outside the apartment door) I just heard him!
CHANDLER: (softly) Can you . . . hear him . . . now?
JOEY: (listens at the door.)� No.� (pause) All right, I'm going in.
CHANDLER: No! Wait!
JOEY: I heard him again!
CHANDLER: (writhes as if in agony) All right, look.� Just stay there.� I'm 
  coming home.
JOEY: Okay.� Great.� I'll see you when you get here.� I'm gonna wait out in 
  the hall in case the dude comes out.
CHANDLER: Is that really necessary?
JOEY: Absolutely.� You'd do it for me.� Not that you ever have to because I 
  know how to keep my women satisfied.
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.� Mike is blowing a note from his beer 
  bottle.� Ross stares off to the side.)
ROSS: Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?� I mean, they said thirty minutes 
  or less.� Well, how long has it been?
MIKE: (looking at his watch) Eleven minutes.� (long pause)� And now twelve.� 
  So, do you like the beer?
ROSS: I do.� I do.� Although, it's actually a lager.
MIKE: huh.� (pause)� What's the difference between beer and lager?
ROSS: I don't know.� We could look it up.
MIKE: (nods) Things are about to get wild.
[Scene: A bar.� Rachel and Phoebe are bringing their drinks from the bar to 
  a sofa.]
PHOEBE: Oh God.� Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around 
  talking about you and Ross?
RACHEL: Oh God.� It seems like forever ago.
PHOEBE: I know.� (sighs)�� So, what's going on with you and Ross?
RACHEL: Well, um . . . I don't know.� I mean, for a long time nothing.� But 
  you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah 
  . . . little thing.
PHOEBE: Oh my God!� I love things.� What happened?
RACHEL: Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked.� And, ah, then we 
  had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.
PHOEBE: Eye-contact?
RACHEL: Mm-hmm.
PHOEBE: I hope you were using protection.
WAITER: (with tray and two drinks)� Excuse me.� Um, these are from the two 
  gentlemen at the end of the bar.
RACHEL: Oh.� (to Phoebe) Should we send them something back?
PHOEBE: Oooh.� Let's do.� Let's send them mashed potatoes.
RACHEL: No!� Wait!� No, no.� Don't do that!� That's going to make them think 
  they can come over here.
PHOEBE: So?� What if they do?
RACHEL: Well, we're not here to meet guys.� You have a boyfriend, I have a 
  b. . . baby and a Ross.
PHOEBE: Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen.� We're just having fun.� 
  You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment.� Chandler is seated in the chair and 
  Monica stands behind the sofa.]
MONICA: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
CHANDLER: Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating 
  on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?� (Monica tips her head 
  slightly as if asking "Did you hear yourself?")� I heard it.
MONICA: I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
CHANDLER: All right.� I've got a plan.� I'll go down the fire escape.
MONICA: Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."
CHANDLER: Hear me out woman.� I'll go down the fire escape.� Then, I'll wait 
  for a while.� Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got 
  back from Tulsa.� Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy 
  in here.
MONICA: Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?� (pause)� 
  I heard it.
(Chandler runs to the window, opens it, starts out, but returns, casually walking 
  back to his chair.)
CHANDLER: I'm just going to wait for a little while.
MONICA: Scary pigeon's back?
CHANDLER: It's huge.
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.� Three pizza crusts, two bottle caps and 
  the plastic tripod are left in the otherwise empty pizza box.� Mike is making 
  hollow popping noises with his mouth.� He begins to speak, but stops and pops 
  his lips a few more times and takes a drink.� Ross smiles as if he has thought 
  of something to say, but then he stops and sinks back in a slump on the sofa.]
[Scene: The bar.� Two men are chatting with Rachel and Phoebe.]
RACHEL: Oh my God.� I can't believe you live in that building.� My grandmother 
  lives in that building.� Ida Green?� No sense of personal space?� Kind of smells 
  like chicken?� Looks like a potato.
BILL: "Spuds" is your grandmother?
RACHEL: That's my bubby!
KEVIN: So, we're on our way to a couple of parties.� Um. . . maybe we can get 
  your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.
PHOEBE: Yeah. . . I'm sorry.� We weren't really looking for anything to happen 
  with you guys.� I, I have a boyfriend.

  KEVIN: All right. It's no big deal.

  BILL: So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?

  RACHEL: Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend.� But 
  um. . .

  BILL: Then, can I have your number?

  RACHEL: (pause) I'm sorry, no.

  BILL: Okay. (They start to walk away.)

  RACHEL: Oh sure.� (She pulls a business card from her purse and writes on it.)

  PHOEBE: (Reading the card.) Oh my God, you're giving your real number.

  BILL: Okay, thanks. I'll give you a call later tonight.

  RACHEL: Great.

  BILL: Bye

  PHOEBE: Bye. (The guys leave.) Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma 
  are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?
RACHEL: I don't know.� He was cute, and he liked me.� It was an impulse.
PHOEBE: What about Ross?� What about your moment?� Don't you want to talk to 
  Ross about it?
RACHEL: No.� No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go.� "Hey 
  Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."
RACHEL: (lowers voice to imitate Ross) "Yeah."� (Clears throat.)� "Me too."
RACHEL: (as herself) "Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about 
  it."
RACHEL: (as Ross) "Yeah."� (Clears throat twice.) "Me neither." (Clears throat 
  again.)
RACHEL: (as herself) "Well, should we just continue to live together and not 
  really tell each other how we're really feeling?"
RACHEL: (as Ross) "Yeah.� That works for me." (Clears throat twice more.)
PHOEBE: Yeah, I see what you mean.� By the way, nice Ross imitation.
RACHEL: Oh, thanks.
PHOEBE: But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
RACHEL: (whining) Wha. . . hey!
PHOEBE: (pointing) Better!
RACHEL: Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments 
  with Ross, you know?� I should just . . . move on with my life.
PHOEBE: Really?� You're moving on from Ross?
RACHEL: I don't know.� Do I have to decide right now?
PHOEBE: Well, you kind of just did.� That guy is going to call you tonight.� 
  Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
RACHEL: Oh God, Ross.� Ross is going to pick up the phone.� Oh, I have to get 
  my number back.� (She turns to find Bill, but they have gone.)� Oh my God.� 
  He's gone.
PHOEBE: (imitating Rachel) "Oh, I have to get my number back.� Oh my God.� 
  He's gone."� (smiles) Dead on.
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.� Ross and Mike are sitting on the sofa.� 
  Ross is fidgeting with the cuff of his sweater while Mike blows his cheeks out.� 
  Ross blows a piece of fuzz from his finger.)
MIKE: (releases a whoosh of air) Ya know, I'm going to take off.
ROSS: So soon?
MIKE: Well, yeah.
ROSS: Okay.� Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.
MIKE: Ah, you mean lager.
ROSS: Ah yeah.� Good times.
(Mike leaves.� Ross closes the door behind him.)
MIKE: (In the hall, relieved) Oh.
(Ross, inside the door, releases a sign of relief.� Back in the hall, Mike's 
  cell phone rings.)
MIKE: Hello?
PHOEBE: (calling from the bar on her cell phone.) Hey, Mike, it's me.� Listen, 
  is um, is Ross near you?
MIKE: Uh, no.� I just left.
PHOEBE: Well, you have to go back in.
MIKE: Wha . . .?� Go back?� To the "land where time stands still"?
PHOEBE: I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and, 
  um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.� So, you have to intercept all 
  his calls.
MIKE: I can't do that!
PHOEBE: (to Rachel) He says he can't do that.
RACHEL: Oh give me , , ,� (Phoebe gives Rachel the phone.)� Hi, Mike?� Hi.� 
  Listen.� I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?� If you do this I . 
  . . Phoebe will . . . do anything you want.� Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
PHOEBE: All right. (She takes the phone from Rachel.)� Hello?� Hi.� I'm sorry 
  about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
MIKE: All right.� I'll do it.� (Phoebe gives the thumbs-up sign to Rachel.)� 
  But really, how much dirtier can it get?
PHOEBE: (knowingly chuckles) Oh, Mike.� Bye.
(Mike knocks on Ross's door.� Ross opens it.)
MIKE: Hey buddy.
ROSS: Uh, hi.
MIKE: Um, can I come back in?
ROSS: (putting his arm up with his hand on the door frame.)� Why?� (He starts 
  to lower his arm.)
MIKE: (Entering the apartment) I, I was just thinking about how much more we 
  have to talk about.
ROSS: (whining) But you left.
[Scene: The hallway and stairs outside Chandler and Monica's apartment.� Chandler 
  enters from the stairs.� Joey is sitting with a baseball bat.]
JOEY: Wow!� That didn't take long.� I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three 
  hour flight.
CHANDLER: (pause) Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
(Joey thinks a moment. Then, he nods.� Joey follows Chandler into the apartment.)
MONICA: (gasp) Chandler!� You're home!
CHANDLER: That's right.� You're husband's home.� So, now the sex can stop.
(Joey gives him and odd look.� Monica gives a similar look.)
MONICA: What are you saying?
CHANDLER: Joey said that you're in here with another man.
MONICA: There's no man in here.� How dare you accuse me of that.� (She slaps 
  Chandler.)
JOEY: All right.� All right.� Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend 
  take a look around, huh?� (He checks the bathroom shaking the bat.� Then he 
  proceeds to their bedroom.)� Bwa-ah-ah!
(Thudding sounds can be heard from the bedroom.)
CHANDLER: (To Monica) What is he doing?
MONICA: (smiling) I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
JOEY: (emerging) Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
CHANDLER: All right.� Well, I'll check the guest room.
JOEY: (sniffing the air and then Monica.)� Why do I smell men's cologne?
MONICA: (sniffing Joey) I think that's you.
JOEY: (sniffs his shirt.)� Oh yeah.� I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
CHANDLER: There's nobody here Joe.
JOEY: I guess not.
MONICA: I can't believe you thought I was cheating.� (pointing at Joey) You 
  own me an apology.
JOEY: Yeah, right Monica.� I'm so sorry.
MONICA: (suddenly starts issuing him out) Ah, it's an honest mistake.� It could 
  happen to anyone.� All right, see ya.
JOEY: (spots the suitcase just inside the door where Chandler left it) Whoa, 
  whoa.� Wait a minute.� Wait a minute.� If you just got back from Tulsa, how 
  did your suitcase beat you here?
CHANDLER: (thinks, then turns to Monica) I climb down the fire escape and you 
  can't put that in the closet?
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.� Mike is reading from a book.]
MIKE: So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the 
  same thing.� Fascinating isn't it.
ROSS: Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
(Phone rings.)
MIKE: I'll get it.� (He lunges across Ross's lap on the sofa to reach the phone.� 
  Ross stares at him with wide eyes.)� Hello?� Ross's place.� Mike speaking.� 
  (pause.� Hands phone to Ross)� It's for you.
ROSS: (takes the phone, but speaks to Mike) I don't understand what just happened 
  here.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment " continuing action.]
JOEY: What's going on?
CHANDLER: I'm sorry.� I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend 
  the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . .� I didn't think you'd understand.
JOEY: What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be 
  with his wife?� Huh?� Do you think I'm like, "Duh."� (He strikes himself in 
  the head with the bat.� He stands dazed for a moment.)
MONICA: Joey?
JOEY: Yeah?� (His eyes bug out.)
MONICA: I don't know what to say.� We shouldn't have lied to you.
CHANDLER: Yeah.� I feel so bad.� Is there anything I can do to make it up to 
  you?
JOEY: (pause) Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know 
  you said you couldn't.� But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a 
  bump on the head.
CHANDLER: I'm sorry. �That's the one thing I can't do.� I promised I'd be with 
  Monica.
JOEY: All right.
MONICA: (taps chandler on the arm) You can go.
CHANDLER: What?
MONICA: You should go to the game.� It's okay.� I want you to.
CHANDLER: Really?� You're gonna be okay?
MONICA: Yeah, I'll be fine.� You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the 
  art of seduction.
CHANDLER: You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
MONICA: It's gonna be so hot!� (She kisses him.)
CHANDLER: Okay, bye.
MONICA: Have fun.
JOEY: Thanks.� (Joey and Chandler exit to the hall.� Joey pulls out the tickets 
  and hands one to Chandler.)� Here's your ticket.
CHANDLER: Hey, listen.� I'm never going to lie to you again, okay?� And I want 
  you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
JOEY: Thanks man.
(Chandler heads toward the stairs, but makes a turn back to his apartment while 
  looking at the ticket.)
JOEY: Where are you going?
CHANDLER: Game's tomorrow night Joe.
(Chandler goes into the apartment, while Joey checks his ticket and is embarrassed 
  by his stupid mistake.)
