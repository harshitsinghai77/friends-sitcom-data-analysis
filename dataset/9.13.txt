[Scene: Chandler and Monica's]
Chandler: Hey!
Ross: Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what 
happened here last night?
Chandler: Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like 
you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what 
they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
Ross: OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
Chandler: No!
Ross: OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from 
her office out on your balcony.
Chandler: Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica 
we should put lights on our balcony. And she said"No, no. It's too cold, 
nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they 
will"
Ross: Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel 
kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !
Chandler: So are you gonna...talk to her?
Ross: Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's 
fine!
Chandler: You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it 
and spits!
Ross: No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care 
but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life 
on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing 
guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! 
Ah!
Chandler: No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where 
you're moving?
Ross: I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now 
there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other 
day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
Chandler: Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
Ross: Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who 
totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.
Chandler: Why did I get married?!
 
 
[Opening Credits]
 
[Scene: Central Perk]
Joey: Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken 
tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows 
waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
Phoebe: Well it depends.
Joey: On...?
Phoebe: On how far along he's in the sex change process!
Monica: No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do 
something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows 
are...
Joey: Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
Phoebe: Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
Joey: Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
Phoebe: Wow! Talking about high maintenance
Joey: Hey hey! You dye your hair!
Phoebe: I'm a woman!
Joey: Arghhh! Double standards!
Phoebe: Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar 
tonight?
Monica: Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
Phoebe: But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable 
old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone 
booed him off the stage. So funny.
Monica: It's just, I'm not good at singing.
Phoebe: Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better 
singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
Monica: No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
Phoebe: OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to 
sing.
Monica: So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass 
judgments on others?
Phoebe: While drinking...
Monica: I'm there!
Rachel: Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something 
really stupid.
Phoebe: Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out 
there
Rachel: No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
Phoebe: Oh my god.
Monica: You kissed him?
Rachel: Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony 
and...
Monica: Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed 
that?
Phoebe: It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping 
paper.
Monica: Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
Rachel: You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me 
and, oh and he gave me this scarf...
Monica: I thought you hated him?
Rachel: You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and 
it turns out that line...is a scarf!
Monica: So are you thinking of starting up something with this 
guy?
Rachel: I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you 
know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don'tknow what to do 
and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.
Monica: Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, 
and you definitely should talk to Ross
Rachel: Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
Phoebe: Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss 
a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!
 
[Scene: Beauty salon]
Salon girl: Hi
Joey: Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
Salon girl: Name?
Joey: Chandler Bing.
Salon girl: Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia 
will be right with you.
Joey: OK Thanks.(Joey touches the hot wax). I touched the 
stuff
Sonia: I'll take care of it
Joey: Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
Sonia: Oh absolutely.
Joey: Oh good...
Sonia: Are you looking to meet somebody?
Joey: All right let's just do this.
Sonia: We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of 
the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...
Joey: Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My 
face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!Just a little bit of shock 
that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK(He tries to avoid the 
tweezers) Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!
[Scene: Central Perk]
Chandler: Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on 
going?
Ross: Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand 
but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
Chandler: Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I 
mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two 
illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....
Ross: That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
Chandler: What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
Ross: I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to 
me
Chandler: Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just 
an impulsive one-time birthday thing
Ross: No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a 
bar.
Chandler: Did she go out with him?
Ross: No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
Chandler: Ah! The high road...
Ross: You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey 
check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!
Chandler: Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
Ross: You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the 
two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of 
jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some 
interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, 
sexy one...
Chandler: I thought I had to make the jokes!
Ross: Don't you have to be at work?
Chandler: Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend 
Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only 
need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!
Ross: Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the 
paper...another flood in Europe? Here�s a question: "Would you...would you 
rather drown or be burnt alive?"
Blonde girl: Sorry...we were just leaving
Chandler: We still got it!
 
[Scene: Ross']
 
Rachel: Who is it?
Gavin: Gavin! I brought you some soup.
Rachel: Why?
Gavin: I heard you were sick...
Rachel: Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little 
bit! Hello Gavin
Gavin: I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?
Rachel: I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick
Gavin: Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I 
thought you called in sick to avoid me.
Rachel: Oh no no no
Gavin: So I had fun last night
Rachel: So did I
Gavin: Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold 
for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?
Rachel: It's just a cold
Gavin: Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...
Rachel: What? What's the matter?
Gavin: What's Ross doing to you on that picture?
Rachel: Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be 
funny.
Gavin: Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want 
to get in the middle of anything
Rachel: Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, 
don't worry about Ross really, really.(She hears the noise of the key in the 
lock) Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!
Gavin: Yeah! But you said not to worry about...
Rachel: I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
Molly: Hi!
Rachel: Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
Molly: No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
Rachel: Right, right, yes!
Molly: Don't panic!
Rachel: What?
Molly: There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my 
purse.
Rachel: No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my 
business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.Gavin come out from behind 
that curtain!
Gavin: Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand 
there.
Molly: Hello! I just go and get Emma.
Rachel: OK.
Gavin: So hum...Why did I have to hide?
Rachel: I thought it was Ross.
Gavin: So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between 
you two...
Rachel: There isn't. There is totally isn't.
Gavin: You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming 
out of a chute for the first time. I used to be arodeo clown.
Rachel: All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were 
here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not inany relationship 
but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus 
there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, 
I'm just all over the place.
Gavin: It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a 
piece of advice?
Rachel: Yes
Gavin: I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
Rachel: People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin
Gavin: Don't be. It's just bad timing.
Rachel: So seriously...rodeo clown?
Gavin: One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...
 
[Scene: Mike's piano bar]
 
Phoebe: "No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the 
world...!" Thank you!
(Mike kisses Phoebe)
Mike: Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to 
get a break and when we come back we've got Kennethsinging "I touch 
myself"...I'm not here to judge!
Phoebe: Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.
Monica: No I told you I can't.
Phoebe: But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice 
voice.
Monica: What have you heard me sing?
Phoebe: All the time when you're cooking.
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in 
my tummy"
Monica: Yeah I do rock that one.
Phoebe: OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up 
there?
Monica: Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I 
would sing...
Mike: Well I've got a book around...
Monica: "Delta Dawn"
 
[Scene: Central Perk]
 
Ross: Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace
Woman: You already hit on me an hour ago
Ross: Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep 
striking out.
Chandler: I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, 
you're asking women how they want to be killed
Ross: This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the 
one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
Chandler: By drowning or...?!
Michelle: Why would he break up with me?
Her friend: I don't know sweetie.
Michelle: All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. 
I mean, am I so unlovable?
Chandler: Well...
Ross: I know! (he stands)
 
 
[Scene: Piano bar]
 
Mike: All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of 
"I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monicasinging "Delta 
Dawn".
Monica: Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
Phoebe: Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that 
spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.
Monica: Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn""Delta 
Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone 
by? ..."
Phoebe: Can you totally see through her shirt ?
Mike: Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.
Monica: "To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
 
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's]
 
Joey: Hey, I need your help.
Chandler: Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley 
Judd?
Joey: Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my 
eyebrows shaped
Chandler: I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
Joey: You may be a sissy but I'll still (pound you out on ground). All 
right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they 
don�t match!
Chandler: It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Joey: All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic 
marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI don�t look stupid for my 
pictures.
Chandler: Ok. First of all, this is green!
Joey: What the hell am I supposed to do!
Chandler: All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you 
will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
Joey: What, what.
Chandler: Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the 
lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows 
of my father and his �business� partners.
Joey: Oh my God!
Chandler: Yeah, well, I guess you don�t need my help Victor 
Victoria!
Joey: Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, 
but Chandler I don�t know if I can take anymoreplucking. It hurts so 
bad!
Chandler: Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my 
gentle self-loathing touch.
 
[Scene: Piano Bar]
 
Monica: "Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is 
over. Did you see me out there?
Phoebe: Every little bit of you!
Monica: I can�t believe I did this. I can�t believe I'm singing for the 
people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear thatone shouting �look at those 
tips�! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?
Mike: Sure.
Phoebe: Mon', not that you didn�t sound good, but...
Monica: Good? Didn�t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for 
making me do this. That�s is the best gift ever.
Mike: Also a good gift? Underwear.
 
[Scene: Ross']
 
Michelle: Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms 
freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone doanything else.
Ross: But, what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it.
Michelle: It�s so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with 
me, because it�s like you lose a boyfriend,you get a boyfriend.
Ross: Uh-ah!
Michelle: No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally 
over Eric.
Ross: (pfew). Good choice Ross.
Rachel: Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I�ve been looking for you 
everywhere!
Ross: Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.
Rachel: Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o� clock. 
So I was hoping you and I could have achance to kind of talk� somebody 
here?
Ross: Oh, yeah, yeah that�s Michelle.
Rachel: Who?
Ross: Oh, just this woman I�ve been seeing.
Rachel: You�ve being seeing someone?
Ross: Yeah, didn�t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven�t being going 
out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. I-I 
mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it 
wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.
Michelle: What are you taking amoxicillin for?
Ross: How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look 
through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that�smy roommate, Rachel.
Rachel: Hi, and I am also Emma�s mother.
Michelle: Ah, who is Emma?
Ross: I told you about my daughter.
Michelle: This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!
 
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's]
 
Chandler: And done!
Joey: Oh my God! I didn�t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a 
job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the 
saloon
Chandler: Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
Joey: Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look 
great! How you doing!
Chandler: Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little 
worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to 
be a little piece of chocolate.
Joey: Thank you so much.
Chandler: No problem.
Joey: Listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some 
manly make up for it.
Chandler: Yeah.
Joey: Comb my eyelashes.
 
[Scene: Piano Bar]
 
Monica: Ok, for my next song I think I�ll sing something a little more 
upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters �I am so excited�. And 
make it bouncy!
Phoebe: Oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands.
Chandler: I am sorry I am late. You�ll understand when you�ll see 
Joey.
Monica: Honey, you�re just in time, I�m about to sing another 
song!
Chandler: Really? In front of all this people?
Monica: And they love me!
Chandler: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Yes, she gives the people what they want.
Monica: All right, watch!
Monica: "Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll 
put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some 
affection..."
Chandler: Are those my wife�s nipples?
Phoebe: Oh? Isn�t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have 
let her go up again.
Chandler: I gotta stop this.
Monica: Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."
Chandler: You, touching yourself, out!
 
[Scene: Ross�]
 
Rachel: Wow. She does that a lot!
Michelle: Ross, you didn�t tell me you were a doctor!
Rachel: What, what, wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a 
doctor, yet? How long have you known her, likean hour?
Michelle: Actually about an hour and a half.
Ross: I told you it wasn�t long, but there is an amazing connection 
between us.
Michelle: You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!
Ross: Are you kidding?
Michelle: Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?
Ross: We�ll see.
Rachel: Ok, Ross, what�s going on here, are we just bringing strange 
women back to the apartment now?
Ross: I don�t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
Rachel: How do you know about that?
Ross: Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to 
sleep...
Michelle: Emma.
Ross: When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a 
guy you know, for what? A week?
Rachel: Oh, that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to 
get back at me?
Michelle: No, actually, see I had to pee, �cause I can�t use public 
bathrooms because the doodie parasites.
Ross: Ok, Michelle, it�s time to go.
Michelle: Well, call me!
Ross: Ok.
Michelle: No, wait, you don�t have my phone number!
Ross: You know, if it�s meant to be, I�ll guess it. Bye, bye.
Rachel: Score.
Ross: Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we 
could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.
Rachel: Oh God, I can�t believe you�re making such a big deal about this. 
It was one kiss, one guy, one time!
Ross: Oh, really!
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: Oh, really!
Rachel: Oh yeah.
Ross: What about the guy from the bar?
Rachel: What? Who?
Ross: The guy you gave your number to.
Rachel: Whoa, how do you know about that?
Ross: Because he called here looking for you. So don�t tell me 
this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? You�ve been 
out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn�t even 
have the courtesy to tell me.
Rachel: Why didn�t I get that message?
Ross: What?
Rachel: From the guy in the bar, why didn�t I get that message?
Ross: Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you 
not look there?
Rachel: Ross?
Ross: I never gave it to you.
Rachel: Why?
Ross: I don�t know.
Rachel: Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to 
decide what messages I should or should not get?
Ross: Who am I?
Rachel: Yes.
Ross: I am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars 
meeting guys!
Rachel: Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in 
here hoping to have a mature conversation with youAbout us! But I can�t do 
that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my 
apartment!
Ross: None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That�s not the 
point. Ok? The point is you...you are the oneWho moved on and didn�t tell 
anyone!
Rachel: Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What�s wrong with us? You 
know when people hear about our situation theyAlways ask, �what, you live 
together but you�re not a couple? And you have a baby, isn�t that weird?� And I 
say �No.You know what, it�s not, because it works for us!� But you know this 
doesn�t work. In fact this is the opposite of working!
Ross: Uh, clearly.
Rachel: And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as 
long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,Just doesn�t make sense 
anymore.
Ross: Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
 
[Scene: Joey's]
 
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
Joey: Ha, oh, of course.
Rachel: Thank you.
Joey: Your eyebrows look weird.
 
[Ending Credits]
 
Chandler: �Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never 
understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine.� So you 
just touch yourself for anything?
