[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]
Phoebe: Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parents
anniversary party?
Monica: Yeah.
Ross: Sure. Yeah.
Joey: So, whos the guy?
Phoebe: Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
Chandler: Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who said
that?
Phoebe: Yeah, hes really great though. He has this incredible zest for
life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty
girl I am.
Monica: (To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom
and dad this year?
Ross: Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
Monica: Yeah, Id really like to.
Ross: Okay, hopefully this time mom wont boo you.
Monica: Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and its always really
moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year Im going to make them cry.
Chandler: And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
Monica: No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him,
and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your
brother." Know what theyll say this year? "God, you"
Joey: Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points to
himself) Im an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)
Monica: Really you can do that?
Joey: Are you kidding me? Watch! (Makes funny faces trying to cry) Well I
cant do it with you guys watching me!
Opening Credits
[Scene: Chandler and Monicas, theyre getting ready to leave for the party.]
Chandler: What are you doing?
Monica: Oh Im working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it.
Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)
Chandler: Its a dog.
Monica: Its a dead dog. Thats Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high
school.
Chandler: Its your parents anniversary and youre going to talk
about their dead pet?
Monica: The good stuff, huh?
(Ross, Joey, and Rachel enter)
Rachel: Hi!
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Monica: You got a present for my parents. Thats so sweet.
Joey: Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a
star named after them. 
Ross: Aww that is so cool.
Joey: And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
Rachel: Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
Chandler: Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia,
gingham, felt, (Pause) and I think my testacles may be in here too.
Ross: (picking up Chi-Chis picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog!
Yknow Monica couldnt get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
Monica: What?!
Ross: You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
(Phoebe and Parker enter)
Phoebe: Hey!
All: Hi!
Phoebe: Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is
Parker: No, no, no wait! Dont tell me. Let me guess. (Points as he says
their names) Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, Im sorry Phoebe didnt mention
you. (Chandler makes a face) Chandler, Im kidding all ready youre my favorite!
Chandler: Ha!
Parker: Why dont all of you tell me a little about your self?
Ross: Ah, actually, Im sorry we-we probably should get going.
Parker: (laughs) Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I? (Puts
hand on her stomach)
Rachel: I, uh, think you already are.
Parker: Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this
world more miraculous thanOh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?
Monica: Thats my old dog. He passed away years ago.
Parker: Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend,
bow-wow. So wheres the party?
Monica: Its out on the island. Its in Massapequa. 
Parker: Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is
it steep in Native American history? {Transcribers Note: Interestingly Alec Baldwin
was born in Massapequa.}
Ross: Well, there is an Arbys in the shape of a tee-pee.
Monica: Okay, I got my note cards. (To Chandler) Do you got the presents? 
Chandler: Yeah.
Monica: And Ive got the car keys.
Parker: Were driving!?
Monica: Yeah.
Parker: Aces!
(Everyone except Ross and Rachel leave.)
Ross: So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
Rachel: Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
Ross: Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
Rachel: Yeah, otherwise Im not going.
[Scene: The Anniversary Party, Ross and Rachel are arriving and see his parents.]
Mr. and Mrs. Geller: Hi
Ross: Hi! (Kisses his mom.) Hey mom.
Rachel: This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have
any pearls of wisdom? 
Mrs. Geller: Jack?
Mr. Geller: Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick? (Looking a
toothpick)
Ross: Thats a good question, dad. Thats a good question
Rachel: Hmmm.
Woman: (To Ross and Rachel) Congratulations you two!
Rachel: Thank youwere so excited
Woman: And also, congratulations on your wedding.
Ross: WhaWhat?
Mrs. Geller: Can we talk to you for just a yknow Its just a
little thing. Well we think its absolutely marvelous that youre having this
baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why weve
told them all that youre married.
Ross and Rachel: What?!
Mrs. Geller: Thanks for going along with this.
Ross: Dad so what we have to pretend that were married?
Mr. Geller: Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.
Ross: Can you believe that?
Rachel: Yeah, if youre going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass
at the nosal area.
Ross: No, us having to lie about being married.
Rachel: No, I know I dont either, but ya know what, its their party,
and its just one night. And we dont even have to lie; we just wont say
anything. If it comes up again, well justsmile. Well nod along.
Woman: Ross!
Man: Rachel!
Ross: Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan
Aunt Lisa: Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding
Ross and Rachel: Hmmmm.
Uncle Dan: Heres a little something to get you started. (Hands them a
check)
Rachel: Oh
Aunt Lisa: So, hows married life treating you?
Rachel: (looking at the check) Unbelievable!
Ross: We love marriage!
Aunt Lisa: Great!
(The rest of the gang arrives including Parker.)
Ross: Hey
Phoebe: Hey!
Parker: What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being
here with all of you in Event Room CI feel so lucky. I think of all the good times
that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none
of them will compare with tonight! My God, I dont want to forget this moment!
Its like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click! (He takes a mental
picture of them all.)
Chandler: I dont think the flash went off.
Parker: Dahaaa! (Punches Chandler in the arm and he makes a face of pain.)
Im going to find the mens room, be right back.
Phoebe: Ill go with you
Parker: Come on!
Chandler: Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge
butterfly net looking for that man.
Joey: I have to go to the bathroom too, but I dont want him complimenting
my thing.
Ross: Im so we werent in the car! Did he ever let up?
Monica: He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
Ross: (imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must
take a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry(He looks behind him then
notices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)
Phoebe: Were you guys making fun of Parker?
Ross: That depends, how much did you hear?
Phoebe: So, he a little enthusiastic, whats wrong with that?
Monica: Its just that, its so much.
Phoebe: Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people youve dated?
Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends dont do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do
you want it? Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the
whos who of human crap. (Walks off)
Monica: I feel terrible.
Joey: I know
Ross: What was wrong with Mona?
Commercial Break
[Scene: The Anniversary Party, Ross and Rachel have just gotten another wedding
present.]
Rachel: Open it! Open it! Open it!
Ross: Yeah baby!
Man: So we never got to hear about your wedding!
Woman: We were surprise that we werent invited.
Ross: No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small
wedding.
Rachel: But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
Man: Where did you have it?
Rachel: On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isnt
She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.
Woman: Really? 
Rachel: Yeah, Stevies an old family friend. (Hits Rosss chest)
Woman: Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.
Rachel: So would I. You wouldnt think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to
put film in the camera.
Ross: Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side)
Umm. what are you doing?
Rachel: What? Im not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want
it to be amazing.
Ross: Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley. 
Rachel: Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.
(Cut to Phoebe and Parker)
Parker: Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.
Phoebe: No, Im fine. Im great. Im with you.
Parker: And Im with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this
plate-bouncy thing. (Bounces the plates) What an inspired solution to mans plate
dispensing problems. 
Phoebe: Hm huh, yeah.
Parker: Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.
Phoebe: No, thats not necessary.
Parker: Please.
Phoebe: No, actually I dont eat
Parker: I wont quit until you try.
Phoebe: Okay, fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while
dropping it on the floor) Mmmhmmmmm.
Parker: What are they like? Ive never had one.
Phoebe: Why dont you just try one?
Parker: No, they look too weird.
(Cut to Monica and Chandler)
Chandler: What are you doin?
Monica: Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit em. I
cant wait. Theyre going to be crying so hard. Theyre going to be
fighting for breath. 
Chandler: Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could
(Punches the air).
(Cut to Rachel and Ross)
Rachel: And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.
Woman: Blind?
Rachel: Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even
though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.
Aunt Lisa: Ill bet you looked beautiful
Rachel: Well, I dont know about that, but some said that I looked like a
floating angel.
Woman: (To Ross) So, how did you propose?
Rachel: Oh yeah. Thats a great story.
Ross: Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium.
Thats-thats where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room
filled with lilies, her favorite flower
Aunt Lisa: Oh that is so sweet!
Rachel: Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
Ross: Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the
sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the
dome in the stars were the words "Will you marry me?"
(Various oohs and ahhs)
Rachel: And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!
(Cut to Phoebe and Joey)
Joey: Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were
being jerks. Parkers a nice guy and Id like to get to know him.
Phoebe: Then you better do it now.
Joey: Why?
Phoebe: Because Im going to kill him
Joey: What-what? 
Phoebe: You guys were right. Hes just too excited abouteverything. I
mean Im all for living life, but this is the Gellers 35th
anniversary. Okay? Lets call a spade a spade this party stinks.
Joey: I know Im having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the
buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!
Phoebe: Are you sure it wasnt an oyster?
Joey: I guess it couldve been, I didnt really look at it.
Yknow, I just wiped it on Chandlers coat and got the hell out of there.
Phoebe: Hes just such a great guy Im so excited about him.
Joey: Oh hey, you should be excited about him. Theres nothing wrong with
him hes a good guy. 
Phoebe: You think?
Joey: Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
Phoebe: Youre right. Youre right, hes just embracing life. We
could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! Im a
sunny, positive person. 
Joey: Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
Phoebe: Whats that now?
Joey: Nothing
Phoebe: Oh look its Parker! 
Parker: Look! Its the bunny hop!
Phoebe: Oooh I love it!
Parker: You do?!
Phoebe: Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
(Cut to Monica, at the microphone)
Monica: Okay its time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually
gives the toast, but this year Im going to do it.
(Everyone sighs)
Monica: No, no its going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got
married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two
of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I
probably dont say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents
will join her.) When I look around this room, Im-Im saddened by the thought of
those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be
here, but she cant because shes dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how
cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the
stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember shes dead. Okay, her and
Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her
children in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didnt see that?
No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes
these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits
for people to cry, but doesnt get any tears.) You people are made of stone!
Heres to mom and dad! Whatever!
Mrs. Geller: Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasnt it
interesting, Jack?
Mr. Geller: (looking at the picture) Why dont I remember this dog?
Mrs. Geller: Ross, why dont you give us your toast now?
Ross: Oh, no, Mom, its just Monica this year.
Mrs. Geller: Youre not going to say anything? On our 35th
wedding anniversary
Ross: No, of course, Um Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to sayon
behalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, that
ifif in 35 years, were half as happy as you guys are, well count
ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
Mrs. Geller: (crying) Oh Ross
Mr. Geller: I just wish Nana were alive to hear Rosss toast.
[Scene: Phoebes apartment, Parker and her are entering.]
Parker: My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!
Phoebe: Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium? 
Parker: I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words
Phoebe: Oh thank God. 
Parker: Its a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the
midst
Phoebe: Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why dont we just um, sit and
relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly! 
Parker: That sounds great. (Sits down) My God this is the most comfortable couch
Ive ever sat on in my entire life. (Bounces on couch)
Phoebe: Lets try something else, lets play a game.
Parker: I love games!
Phoebe: Shocking! Lets play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
(Giggles)
Parker: OrJenga.
Phoebe: But, lets play this one first. And remember whoever talks first
loses! 
(They sit back)
Parker: I lose, now Jenga.
Phoebe: Oh my God! Oh my God! 
Parker: Is something wrong?
Phoebe: Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isnt perfect?
Everything isnt magical? Everything isnt a glow with the light of a million
fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker! 
Parker: Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!
Phoebe: You dont have to put a good spin on everything.
Parker: Im sorry thats who I am. Im a positive person.
Phoebe: No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland,
getting laid! 
Parker: So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less
happy?
Phoebe: Much less happy!
Parker: Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "Id better be going." 
Phoebe: So long! Dont let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on
your way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)
(Theres a knock on door, and Phoebe opens it.)
Parker: Isnt this the most incredible fight youve ever had in your
entire life? 
Phoebe: Uh huh. (Closes door)
[Scene: Ross and Rachels, theyre returning from the party.]
Ross: and then, we couldve gone from the ceremony to the reception
with you in the sidecar!
Rachel: Ross, it just wouldnt have been feasible.
Ross: But having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no
problem?
Rachel: It was really fun being married to you tonight. 
Ross: Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks Ive ever made.
Rachel: Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: That proposal, at the planetarium
Ross: I know, I know it was stupid. 
Rachel: Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the
stars! It wasreally wonderful! Did you just make that up? 
Ross: No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. Its
how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me. 
Rachel: Well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too. 
Ross: Its a good thing I didnt do it, because it sounds like it
wouldve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay, good night
Rachel: Goodnight
(They go off to their bedrooms)
Ross: Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messed
up? 
Rachel: I will think about it. 
Ross: Thats all Im askin 
Ending Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Monica are there.]
Monica: Okay thats it. I give up. At mom and dads 40th
anniversary, youre the one giving the speech. 
Ross: Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a
beautiful speech. 
Monica: Oh, come on. 
Ross: Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we
did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.
And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there. And
you know what? I think she was. 
Monica: (starts to cry) Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
