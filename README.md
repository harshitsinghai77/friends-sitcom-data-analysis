This repository dives into FRIENDS sitcom’s scripts using Python to find out more, including the most popular characters and their journey through the seasons.

The text files used in this projects contain scripts from the T.V. show F.R.I.E.N.D.S. and was downloaded from [this repository](https://fangj.github.io/friends/). 
Exported text files into a SQLite database using Python. Then provide some interesting findings about the characters we know so well, some expected and some surprising! It has been a really enjoyable hobby project and one I have been wanting to do for a while.

# Introduction
Providing an alternative look to the most looked sitcom.
So, I just finished watching Friends recently, again. FRIENDS is one of my favorite sitcoms and I’m sure I’m not alone in having rewatched the entire series more than once. I’ve always wondered if there was anything left to know about this group.

The first time I watched the show in 2016, I didn’t have any clue about data analysis or Python, let alone know how to use it. So, after watching it again during the coronavirus break, I thought, I have the data, I love the show, I love Python.. does that mean, it’s time for another quick data analysis side project?
