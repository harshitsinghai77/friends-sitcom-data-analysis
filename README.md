# FRIENDS sitcom data analysis using Python
This repository dives into FRIENDS sitcomâ€™s scripts using Python to find out more, including the most popular characters and their journey through the seasons.

The text files used in this projects contain scripts from the T.V. show F.R.I.E.N.D.S. and was downloaded from [this repository](https://fangj.github.io/friends/). 
Exported text files into a SQLite database using Python. Then provide some interesting findings about the characters we know so well, some expected and some surprising! It has been a really enjoyable hobby project and one I have been wanting to do for a while.
